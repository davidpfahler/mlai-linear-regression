# ML&AI linear regression

The purpose of this repository is to teach myself the linear regression algorithm by creating a simple algorithm from scratch. I went with JavaScript first, then ported it to Python.

## What can you do with linear regression?
Linear regression can answer these questions:

1. How are variables correlated?
2. What would be the value of one variable `y` assuming some values for all other variables? (Prediction)
3. How good is the prediction?

## How does linear regression work?

Linear regression is called linear, because a linear equation can be found that approximates the given dataset. In case of a dataset with two variables (`x` and `y`) this linear equation would be of the form `y = m * x + t` (also written as `y = b0 + b1 * x`), which plotted would literally draw a line. When there are three variables, the equation would be of the form `y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2`, which can be visualized as a plain. For more variables, a higher dimension visualization is tricky to imagine, but the concept stays the same.
